        <p>
          Hi! My name is Joel Mayorga, I'm from Argentina, and I love programming and game development. <br>
          I am from a city called Villa Mercedes in the province of San Luis. I was a missionary in the Chile Santiago Sur Mission, 
          and I served there for less than a year because of the coronavirus. <br>
          Due to the pandemic, we had to return to our country. After a few days in a hotel, I was reassigned to the Salta Argentina Mission. 
          We spent several months without being able to go to the province of Salta due to Covid-19 restrictions.<br>
          I am currently a logistics student at a college here in my city. I am also a programming fan, 
          working independently on a 2D RPG Video Game. Due to my studies, I have had to slow down the development of this my first video game, 
          but I hope I can speed up work in mid-June. <br>
          In the next few years, I'll be working on 3D videogames, as well as 3D and 2D animations, and much more videogames either on my own 
          or with a work team.

      <p>Argentina, land of "el mate", tasty roasts, tango, good football and more. <br>
        It is the second largest country in South America, after Brazil. It is a federation of 23 provinces and an autonomous city,
        Buenos Aires, the most industrialized region. The country is rich in natural resources, particularly lead, zinc, tin, copper, magnesium, 
        oil, and uranium. In Argentina, each of the twenty-three federated states named in the Constitution of the Argentine Nation is called a 
        province, which together with the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires constitute the first-order jurisdictions-territorial divisions of the country.
